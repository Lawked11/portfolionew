                        <h2>Learning Programming Language</h2>
                        <p>In 2022, I made a huge shift by enrolling as an IT student, even though I came from an ABM background in senior high with little to no tech experience. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but everything changed when I discovered C programming. Suddenly, coding felt like something I could connect with, and I was hooked. From there, I started exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I was amazed at how these languages brought websites to life. I also started using Visual Studio, which quickly became my go-to tool as I dove deeper into programming. Each new challenge, whether it was mastering a language or figuring out a bug, felt like a small victory, and it kept me motivated. Looking back, that year was the beginning of something exciting, and it fueled my passion for technology that I’m still chasing today.</p>

                        <h2>Learning Datase, C, and C++</h2>
                        <p>In 2023-2024, I took my learning to new heights by diving into databases, C#, and C++. I was fascinated by how databases work and how they help organize and manage information suddenly, everything about data storage made more sense. At the same time, I started learning C# and C++, which challenged me in new ways and expanded my programming knowledge. These languages helped me understand the deeper mechanics of software development, and I was excited to see how I could use them to build more complex applications. This year really pushed me to grow and opened up so many new doors in the world of tech.</p>

                        <h2>Learning Flutter</h2>
                        <p>This year, I’ve been diving into databases, Flutter, and of course, making more websites. It’s been an exciting time as I try to pull all these pieces together and really level up my skills. I’m pushing myself to go beyond where I am now, hoping to tackle bigger challenges and create even more complex projects. It feels like I'm constantly learning and growing, and I can’t wait to see how far I can take it.</p>
