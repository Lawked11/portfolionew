                <h2>Web Development</h2>
                <p>As a student, I’ve developed two online platforms a shoe market and a food ordering website that I’m proud to say are up and running, though they’re not published yet. Building these sites has been a hands on journey, letting me apply my skills to real world concepts. Whether it's helping people find the perfect pair of shoes or easily ordering their favorite meals, I’ve focused on creating a seamless and user friendly experience. This work has deepened my passion for web development, and I’m excited to continue refining these projects as I learn and grow.</p>
